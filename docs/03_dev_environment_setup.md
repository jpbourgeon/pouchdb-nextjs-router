## Setup the development environment

You need VS Code, the Remote Development extension pack, and docker on your computer. Installing and configuring these tools it out of this documentation's scope.

1. Start VS Code and run Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume... from the Command Palette (F1).
1. Enter `jpbourgeon/pouchdb-nextjs-router` or `https://github.com/jpbourgeon/pouchdb-nextjs-router` in the input box that appears and press Enter.

You can find more on how to make it work here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume>.
